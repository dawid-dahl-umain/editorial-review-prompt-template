#### Observations

##### Observation #1: Repetition of "Reference as needed"

- **Lines:** 141-142
- **Category:** Consistency

**What I Noticed:**
Section "For AI Assistants" says "Reference as needed: [Reference Guide](reference.md) - for templates and technical details"

**Context:**
This phrasing appeared in the README and was identified as potentially misleading since AIs can't automatically reference files. However, in this context within the instructions themselves, it's less problematic since all files would typically be provided together.

**Consideration:**
Should this be rephrased for consistency with how the README now handles this, or is it acceptable here since it's within the instructions that would all be provided together?

**Potential Impact:**
If changed: Maintains consistency with README messaging
If unchanged: Acceptable since context is different (all instruction files provided together)

#### Review Notes

Clean, well-organized entry point document. Serves its purpose effectively as a navigation hub to the three main instruction files. No actual issues detected.
