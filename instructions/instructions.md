**Key Decision Points:**

- **Fix vs Track/Defer**: Grammar/links/consistency errors ‚Üí Fix. Subjective/unclear ‚Üí Track/Defer.
- **Issue vs Observation**: Objective error ‚Üí Issue. Requires human judgment ‚Üí Observation.
- **Continue vs Pause**: Every 10 files, pause for user confirmation.

## Formatting Standards (Schema)

**These formatting rules are MANDATORY for consistency:**

### Dates & Times

- **Date format:** `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-10-01`)
- **Time format:** `HH:MM` 24-hour (e.g., `14:30`)
- **DateTime format:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (e.g., `2025-10-01 14:30`)

### Status Indicators

- **Status format:** `[Emoji] [TEXT IN CAPS]`
  - ‚úÖ `üü° IN PROGRESS`
  - ‚úÖ `‚úÖ COMPLETED`
  - ‚úÖ `‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED`
  - ‚ùå NOT: `In Progress üü°` or `Completed` or `‚úÖ completed`

### Severity Indicators

- **Format:** `[Emoji] [Text in Title Case]`
  - ‚úÖ `üî¥ Critical`
  - ‚úÖ `üü° Medium`
  - ‚úÖ `üü¢ Low`
  - ‚ùå NOT: `Critical üî¥` or `üî¥ CRITICAL`

### Numbers in Tables

- **Zero values:** Use `0` (not or `None`)
- **Placeholders in template:** Use `[#]`
- **Actual values:** Plain numbers, no formatting (e.g., `42` not `42 issues`)

### Percentages

- **Format:** One decimal place + `%` (e.g., `45.2%`)
- **Special case:** `100%` or `0%` (no decimals when whole numbers)

### File Paths

- **Format:** Relative from repository root, forward slashes
- **Example:** `appendices/appendix-a/file.md`
- ‚ùå NOT: `./appendices/appendix-a/file.md` or `\appendices\`

### Lists

- **Unordered:** Use (hyphen), one space after
- **Ordered:** Use `1.` `2.` etc., one space after
- **Checkboxes:** `[ ]` for unchecked, `[x]` for checked

### Headings

- **H1:** `#` (used only for document title)
- **H2:** `##` (used for major sections)
- **H3:** `###` (used for file entries)
- **H4:** `####` (used for subsections within files)
- **H5:** `#####` (used for individual issues)
- **Format:** One space after `#` symbols

### Code Blocks

- **Fenced with triple backticks:** ```
- **Language hint when applicable:** ```markdown
- **No language hint for plain text:** ```

### Tables

- **Header separator:** Use `|---|---|---|` format
- **Alignment:** Left-align text, right-align numbers (using `--:`)
- **Spacing:** One space padding inside each cell
- **Example:**
  ```markdown
  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Count || -------- | -------- | ----: || Text | Text | 42 |
  ```

### Horizontal Rules

- **Format:** Use `--` (three hyphens) on its own line
- **Spacing:** One blank line before and after

### Emphasis

- **Bold:** `*text**` (not `__text__`)
- **Italic:** `_text_` (not `text*`)
- **Inline code:** `text`

### Counters Format

- **In header:** `Files Completed: X/Y` (with space after colon)
- **In tables:** Just the number (e.g., `42`)

### Issue Numbering

- **Format:** `Issue #1:` `Issue #2:` etc.
- **Sequential:** Start at 1 for each file
- **Persistent:** Don‚Äôt renumber if issues are fixed

### Boolean Checks

- **Format:** `‚úÖ` for yes/true/good, `‚ùå` for no/false/bad
- **In sentences:** Use emoji then text (e.g., `‚úÖ Fixed` not `Fixed ‚úÖ`)

## Quick Start (TL;DR for AI)

1. Scan repo for .md files
2. Create EDITORIAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md with template
3. For each file: review ‚Üí document ‚Üí update counters
4. Generate summary with cohesion analysis
5. Report final status to user

## Instructions for AI

When a user asks you to perform an editorial review (e.g., ‚ÄúReview all markdown files‚Äù or ‚ÄúEditorial review of this repo‚Äù), follow this process exactly:

### Step 1: Confirm and Clarify

**First Response to User:**

```
I'll perform a comprehensive editorial review of your repository's markdown files.

I will:
1. Create EDITORIAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md to track all findings
2. Review each .md file systematically
3. Fix issues as I find them (when appropriate)
4. Document everything in the findings file
5. Provide a final summary

Scanning repository for markdown files...
```

**How to scan:** See [Technical Implementation Details ‚Üí File Discovery](about:blank#file-discovery)

**Then list files found alphabetically:**

```
Found [X] markdown files:
- README.md
- docs/guide.md
- appendices/appendix-a.md
[...etc...]

Shall I proceed with reviewing all [X] files?
```

**If user says yes, proceed to Step 2**

**If user specifies subset:** ‚ÄúOnly review X, Y, Z files‚Äù ‚Üí Proceed with only those files

### Step 2: Create Findings Document

Create `/EDITORIAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md` with this exact structure:

```markdown
# Editorial Review Findings**Review Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Status:** üü° IN PROGRESS
**Files Completed:** 0/[TOTAL]
**Issues Found:** 0
**Issues Fixed:** 0
**Observations:** 0
This document tracks all findings from the comprehensive editorial review.

## Legend### Issue Types- üî¥ **Critical**: Broken links, factual errors, major grammar issues

- üü° **Medium**: Minor grammar, inconsistent terminology, style issues
- üü¢ **Low**: Suggestions, optional improvements

### Issue Status- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Issue resolved during review

- üìù **Tracked**: Known issue, intentionally not fixed
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Deferred**: To be addressed later

### Observations- üí≠ **Observation**: Not an error, but something worth flagging for human consideration

- Potential improvements requiring judgment
- Questions about content/structure/format
- Subjective suggestions beyond mechanical fixes
- These are NOT fixed by AI - only documented for user review

## Review Progress*Check off sections as you complete them:*

- [ ] Core documentation
- [ ] Appendices/Supporting docs
- [ ] Templates/Commands
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Consistency analysis
- [ ] Final summary

---

## Files Reviewed*Entries will be added here as files are reviewed.*

---

## Summary*Summary will be generated after all files are completed.*
```

### Step 3: Review Files One by One

**For EACH file:**

1. **Add a file entry immediately** (before reviewing):

```markdown
### üìÑ path/to/file.md**Review Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**Status:** üü° REVIEWING
**Issues Found:** 0
**Issues Fixed:** 0
**Observations:** 0
_Review in progress..._

---
```

1. **Review the file** (read it using your file reading tool) checking:

   **Grammar & Mechanics:**

   - Subject-verb agreement (‚ÄúThe files is‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe files are‚Äù)
   - Tense consistency (don‚Äôt switch between past/present/future within same context)
   - Pronoun agreement (‚ÄúEach user should check their code‚Äù vs ‚Äúhis/her code‚Äù)
   - Sentence fragments (incomplete sentences lacking subject or verb)
   - Run-on sentences (multiple independent clauses improperly joined)
   - Comma splices (two sentences joined with only a comma)
   - Punctuation (missing periods, incorrect comma usage, apostrophes)
   - Capitalization consistency

   **Spelling:**

   - Typos and misspellings
   - Consistent spelling variants (e.g., ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù vs ‚Äúbehaviour‚Äù - pick one)

   **Links:**

   - Internal anchors, relative paths, external URLs, images
   - See [Technical Implementation Details ‚Üí Link Verification](about:blank#link-verification)

   **Terminology Consistency:**

   - Key terms used consistently (same concept = same name)
   - Capitalization of terms (e.g., ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù vs ‚Äútodo‚Äù vs ‚ÄúTODO‚Äù)
   - Acronyms defined on first use

   **Structure:**

   - Heading hierarchy (no skipped levels: H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3, not H1 ‚Üí H3)
   - TOC matches actual headings
   - No duplicate headings at same level (confuses anchor links)

   **Formatting Consistency:**

   - List styles (all bulleted or all numbered within same context)
   - Code block language hints
   - Bold/italic usage patterns
   - Table formatting

2. **Update the entry** with findings using this template:

```markdown
### üìÑ path/to/file.md**Review Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issues Found:** [#]
**Issues Fixed:** [#]
**Observations:** [#]#### Issues[IF NO ISSUES:]‚úÖ **No issues found**
**Review Summary:**

- ‚úÖ Grammar and spelling correct
- ‚úÖ All links working
- ‚úÖ Consistent with repository standards
- ‚úÖ Structure clear and logical
  [IF ISSUES FOUND, list each one:]##### Issue #1: [Brief Title]**Lines:** [specific line numbers]
  **Severity:** üî¥/üü°/üü¢
  **Type:** Grammar | Link | Consistency | Structure | Other
  **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed | üìù Tracked | ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred
  **Description:**
  [Clear explanation of the problem]**Original:**
```

[Show the problematic content exactly as it appears]

```

**Resolution:**
[‚úÖ Fixed to: "..." | üìù Tracked because: ... | ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred because: ...]

---

[Repeat for each issue]

#### Observations

[IF NO OBSERVATIONS:]
_No observations - file meets all standards._

[IF OBSERVATIONS EXIST:]

##### Observation #1: [Brief Title]

**Lines:** [specific line numbers or "General"]
**Category:** Content | Structure | Format | Tone | Consistency | Other
**Question/Suggestion:**
[Clear description of what you've noticed and why it might be worth considering]

**Context:**
[Provide relevant context: what's there now, why it caught your attention, what alternatives exist]

**User Decision Needed:**
[What question should the user answer? What choice should they make?]

---

[Repeat for each observation]

#### Review Notes
[Optional: overall quality assessment, relation to other files, patterns noticed]

---
```

1. **Update the document header** after each file:

   See [Technical Implementation Details ‚Üí Document Update Pattern](about:blank#document-update-pattern) for exact sequence.

   ```markdown
   **Files Completed:** X/Y
   **Issues Found:** [total]**Issues Fixed:** [total]**Observations:** [total]
   ```

2. **Report to user**: ‚Äú‚úÖ Completed [filename] - Found X issues, Fixed Y, Z observations‚Äù

   See [Technical Implementation Details ‚Üí Progress Reporting](about:blank#progress-reporting) for frequency.

3. **Continue to next file** without waiting (unless user interrupts or every 10 files)

### Step 4: Generate Final Summary

**After ALL files reviewed**, replace the Summary section with:

```markdown
## Summary**Review Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Total Files Reviewed:** [#]### Statistics| Metric | Count || --------------------------- | ----- || **Total Issues Found** | [#] || **Issues Fixed** | [#] || **Issues Tracked** | [#] || **Issues Deferred** | [#] || **Observations Flagged** | [#] || **Files With No Issues** | [#] || **Files With Observations** | [#] |### Issue Breakdown by Severity| Severity | Count | Fixed | Remaining || ----------- | ----- | ----- | --------- || üî¥ Critical | [#] | [#] | [#] || üü° Medium | [#] | [#] | [#] || üü¢ Low | [#] | [#] | [#] |### Issue Breakdown by Type| Type | Found | Fixed || ------------------------ | ----- | ----- || Grammar/Spelling | [#] | [#] || Broken Links | [#] | [#] || Inconsistent Terminology | [#] | [#] || Structural Issues | [#] | [#] || Other | [#] | [#] |### Repository Cohesion Analysis**Terminology Consistency:**

## Technical Implementation Details

**How to implement each step using your available tools:**

### File Discovery

**How to find all markdown files:**

1. **If you have `glob_file_search` tool:** Use pattern `*/*.md`
2. **If you have `list_dir` tool:** Recursively list directories and filter for `.md` files
3. **If you have neither:** Ask user to provide list of markdown files

**Review Order:** Alphabetically by full path (e.g., `README.md` before `docs/guide.md` before `docs/setup.md`)

### Incremental Document Updates

**Critical:** Update `EDITORIAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md` after EACH file, not all at once at the end.

**How to update:**

1. **If you have `search_replace` tool:**
   - Use it to update specific sections (header counts, add file entries)
   - Update header after each file: `*Files Completed:** X/Y`
2. **If you don‚Äôt have `search_replace`:**
   - Recreate the entire document with updates
   - Preserve all previous entries

**Where to add new entries:** Always append after the last file entry, before the Summary section

### Link Verification

**How to check each link type:**

1. **Internal Anchors** (`#heading-id`):
   - Read the target file
   - Search for the heading (convert to lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens)
   - Verify heading exists
2. **Relative Paths** (`../other/file.md`):
   - Calculate the absolute path from current file location
   - Verify target file exists (use `read_file` with offset to check)
   - If file doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Üí üî¥ Critical broken link
3. **External URLs** (`https://example.com`):
   - Check URL structure looks valid (has protocol, domain)
   - Don‚Äôt actually test HTTP status (slow/unreliable)
   - If URL is obviously malformed ‚Üí üü° Medium issue
4. **Image Links**:
   - Same as relative paths if local
   - Same as external URLs if remote

### Progress Reporting

**After each file, tell user:**

```
‚úÖ Completed [filename] - Found X issues, Fixed Y, Z observations
```

(If no observations: ‚Äú‚úÖ Completed [filename] - Found X issues, Fixed Y‚Äù)

**Every 10 files, pause and ask:**

```
Completed 10 files. Continue with next batch? (Y/n)
```

**If user doesn‚Äôt respond in 30 seconds, continue automatically** (they can interrupt if needed)

### Document Update Pattern

**After reviewing each file, update in this order:**

1. Add complete file entry (with all issues and observations documented)
2. Update header: `*Files Completed:** [increment by 1]`
3. Update header: `*Issues Found:** [add new issues]`
4. Update header: `*Issues Fixed:** [add newly fixed]`
5. Update header: `*Observations:** [add new observations]`
6. Report to user

**Example update sequence:**

```
1. Review file A ‚Üí Found 2 issues (fixed 1), 1 observation
2. Update EDITORIAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md:
   - Add file A entry (with Issues section AND Observations section)
   - Files Completed: 0/22 ‚Üí 1/22
   - Issues Found: 0 ‚Üí 2
   - Issues Fixed: 0 ‚Üí 1
   - Observations: 0 ‚Üí 1
3. Report: "‚úÖ Completed file A - Found 2 issues, Fixed 1, 1 observation"
4. Continue to file B
```

### Tool Availability Handling

**If you lack certain tools:**

- No `glob_file_search` ‚Üí Ask user for file list
- No `search_replace` ‚Üí Recreate entire document each time
- No `read_file` ‚Üí Ask user if link targets exist
- Limited to X tokens output ‚Üí Batch files in groups

**Always work within your tool constraints** - Don‚Äôt fail because a tool is missing, adapt the approach.

## Decision Rules for AI

### When to Fix vs Track vs Defer

**‚úÖ Fix immediately when:**

- Clear grammar/spelling error
  - Example: ‚ÄúThe files is complete‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe files are complete‚Äù
  - Example: ‚ÄúHe write code daily‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúHe writes code daily‚Äù
- Tense inconsistency within same context
  - Example: ‚ÄúFirst, we created the file. Then we update it.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúFirst, we created the file. Then we updated it.‚Äù
  - Example: ‚ÄúThe user clicks submit and saw an error‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe user clicks submit and sees an error‚Äù
- Broken internal link with obvious fix
- Obvious inconsistency (e.g., one doc uses ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù others use ‚ÄúTODO‚Äù)
- Missing punctuation
- Wrong heading level
- Spelling variants inconsistent (‚Äúbehavior‚Äù in file A, ‚Äúbehaviour‚Äù in file B ‚Üí standardize)

**üìù Track (don‚Äôt fix) when:**

- Intentional placeholder (like ‚ÄúComing soon‚Äù)
- Style preference rather than error
- Would require understanding author‚Äôs intent
- External factors (waiting for published URL)

**‚è∏Ô∏è Defer when:**

- Requires discussion with author
- Significant rewrite needed
- Uncertain about correct approach
- User might have different preference

**When uncertain:** Default to ‚úÖ Fix if it‚Äôs objectively wrong, üìù Track if subjective.

### When to Flag Observations

**üí≠ Flag as Observation when:**

- Content might benefit from reorganization, but current structure is functional
  - Example: ‚ÄúSection X covers topics A, B, C. Section Y also mentions B. Consider consolidating B discussion?‚Äù
- Format choice is valid but alternatives might be better
  - Example: ‚ÄúThis 4-paragraph explanation could be a comparison table. Would that improve scanability?‚Äù
- Tone shifts between sections/files, but not incorrect
  - Example: ‚ÄúMost docs use ‚Äòwe‚Äô, but this one uses ‚Äòyou‚Äô. Intentional distinction or inconsistency?‚Äù
- Potential duplication between documents
  - Example: ‚ÄúThis content appears similar to section X in file Y. Is this intentional redundancy or should one reference the other?‚Äù
- Examples could be more complete/clear
  - Example: ‚ÄúCode example shows function call but not the function definition. Would including both help?‚Äù
- Terminology is consistent within file but differs from other files
  - Example: ‚ÄúThis file uses ‚Äòuser story‚Äô, others use ‚Äòscenario‚Äô. Align or keep distinct?‚Äù
- Missing content that might be expected
  - Example: ‚ÄúSection mentions ‚Äòthree strategies‚Äô but only explains two. Is third missing or just not detailed?‚Äù
- Format/structure differs from similar documents
  - Example: ‚ÄúOther appendices have ‚ÄòPrerequisites‚Äô section, this one doesn‚Äôt. Intentional or oversight?‚Äù
- Links work but might point to better targets
  - Example: ‚ÄúLink goes to page root, but section #specific-topic would be more precise‚Äù
- Technical level seems inconsistent with apparent audience
  - Example: ‚ÄúDoc is labeled ‚Äòbeginner guide‚Äô but assumes knowledge of advanced concepts. Revise level or label?‚Äù

**What Observations Should NOT Be:**

- ‚ùå Grammar/spelling errors ‚Üí These are Issues
- ‚ùå Broken links ‚Üí These are Issues
- ‚ùå Clear factual errors ‚Üí These are Issues
- ‚ùå Personal preferences with no rationale ‚Üí Don‚Äôt document
- ‚ùå Vague ‚Äúcould be better‚Äù statements ‚Üí Be specific or skip

**Observations should:**

- ‚úÖ Provide specific context (line numbers, what‚Äôs there, what alternatives exist)
- ‚úÖ Explain WHY it caught your attention
- ‚úÖ Present a clear question or decision point for the user
- ‚úÖ Be actionable (user can act on it or dismiss it)
- ‚úÖ Respect author‚Äôs judgment (phrased as question, not directive)

### Severity Assignment

**üî¥ Critical:**

- Broken links to key navigation
- Major factual errors
- Severe grammar that obscures meaning
- Missing critical sections

**üü° Medium:**

- Minor grammar issues
- Inconsistent terminology
- Formatting issues
- Minor structural problems

**üü¢ Low:**

- Stylistic suggestions
- Optional improvements
- Nice-to-have additions
- Minor polish items

### Consistency Checking

**Track these patterns across ALL files:**

1. Key terminology (how are main concepts named?)
2. Tone (formal? conversational? technical?)
3. Structure patterns (similar docs use similar formats?)
4. Example domains (do examples reference consistent concepts?)
5. Emoji usage (if used, consistent meanings?)
6. Code style (indentation, naming, patterns?)
7. Link style (relative vs absolute, with/without extensions?)

**Note patterns in individual file entries AND in final summary.**

## Important Guidelines

### DO:

‚úÖ Fix obvious errors immediately

‚úÖ Explain ALL decisions (why fixed OR why not)

‚úÖ Flag observations for things that require human judgment

‚úÖ Phrase observations as questions, not directives

‚úÖ Update the document after EACH file (not all at once at end)

‚úÖ Be thorough but efficient

‚úÖ Check links by actually verifying paths/anchors

‚úÖ Look for consistency across the entire repository

‚úÖ Preserve the author‚Äôs voice and intent

‚úÖ Give clear, actionable recommendations

### DON‚ÄôT:

‚ùå Report subjective preferences as issues (use observations instead)

‚ùå Flag observations for clear errors (grammar/links are issues)

‚ùå Write vague observations like ‚Äúcould be better‚Äù (be specific)

‚ùå Rewrite content unnecessarily

‚ùå Wait until the end to update findings document

‚ùå Skip checking links because ‚Äúthey look ok‚Äù

‚ùå Ignore small issues (typos matter!)

‚ùå Make assumptions about unfixed placeholders

‚ùå Rush through files to finish faster

‚ùå Change technical terminology without certainty

## Edge Cases & FAQs

**Q: What if the repository is huge (100+ files)?**

A: After every 10 files, pause and ask: ‚ÄúCompleted 10 files. Continue with next 10?‚Äù This prevents overwhelming output.

**Q: What if files are in subfolders with complex structure?**

A: Review in alphabetical order by full path. Group by directory in your report if helpful.

**Q: What if I find the same issue in many files?**

A: Fix it in each file, but in the summary note: ‚ÄúPattern: [issue X] found in 15 files - all fixed.‚Äù

**Q: What if a file has dozens of issues?**

A: Document all of them. If it needs major work, note in Review Notes: ‚ÄúThis file requires significant attention.‚Äù

**Q: What if user interrupts the process?**

A: The findings document shows progress. User can ask you to resume, and you continue from where you left off.

**Q: What if there are non-.md files that might need review?**

A: Stick to .md files unless user specifically requests others. Note in final summary: ‚ÄúOnly .md files reviewed. Consider reviewing [other file types] separately.‚Äù

**Q: Should I check external URLs for HTTP status?**

A: Note if they exist and look correct. If a URL appears broken (404), mark as critical. Don‚Äôt verify every external URL unless obviously wrong.

**Q: How detailed should grammar checking be?**

A: Catch obvious errors. Don‚Äôt be pedantic about style unless it impacts clarity.
